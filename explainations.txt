Question 01:
Confirming Inputs: two strings s and t

Question 03:
Confirming inputs: Undirected Graph G

Test Cases: Input value is not a dictionary/empty, length of G is less than 2 so there is no connection between two nodes

Brainstorm: From the keywords of undirected graph and minimum spanning tree I deduced that I can use the logic behind Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm. First I need to sort the edges by weight. Then pick the smallest edges one by one but making sure no cycles form
